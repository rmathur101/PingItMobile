THOUGHTS

*what do I need to send the data from the phone to the web app???

*we need to have something to hold the data from the create form that we can send
*what is that going to be? Well we try putting the data in the NSUserDefault and see if we can take that hash and access it wehn we make the http request using buble wrap
*what can I do right now? well I can assume there is a way to get the information into the NSUserDefaults. Let's say that I am storing the data somewhere and let's see how i can access that data and send it via buble wrap.
